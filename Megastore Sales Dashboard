## **Data Cleaning and Preparation**

### **Cleaning Process:**  
To ensure the accuracy of the analysis, the dataset was cleaned to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format columns. Specific steps included:
- **Missing Values:** Any rows with missing essential data (such as `Customer_ID` or `Amount`) were removed.
- **Data Formatting:** Columns such as `Date`, `Year`, `Month`, and `Time` were formatted to ensure consistency.
- **Data Integrity:** Duplicates were identified and removed to maintain the integrity of the dataset.

### **Preparation for Analysis:**  
The data was prepared by creating new calculated fields in Tableau, such as:
- **Total Revenue:** Calculated as `Amount` multiplied by the number of purchases.
- **Profit:** Calculated as SUM([Total Sales])- SUM([Amount])
- **Custom ID:** Calculated the Country Abbreviation and the Transaction ID : [Country Abr] + "-" + STR(INT([Transaction ID]))
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** An estimate of the total value a customer will bring to the business over time.

## **Insights and Conclusions**

### **Key Findings:**
   - **High-Value Customers:** The analysis revealed a segment of customers who contribute a significant portion of the total revenue resides in the United States. These customers are primarily interested in premium products and have a higher average order value.

   - **Product Insights:** Electronics and apparel were identified as the top-performing categories, with certain brands consistently leading in sales.

### **Business Implications:**
   - **Targeted Marketing:** Focus marketing efforts on high-value customer segments, especially during peak seasons, to maximize revenue.

## **Challenges and Limitations**

### **Challenges:**
   - **Data Quality:** Some customer data had missing fields or inconsistencies, which required extensive cleaning.
